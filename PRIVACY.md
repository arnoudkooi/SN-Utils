# Privacy Policy
Arnoud Kooi built the SN Utils app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by Arnoud Kooi at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use SN Utils.

If you choose to use my SN Utils, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Security
